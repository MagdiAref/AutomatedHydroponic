# AutomatedHydroponic
This code is designed to control an automated greenhouse tent using a single board computer such as a Raspberry Pi. It reads the humidity, pH, light level, and nutrient input in the greenhouse tent using sensors, and uses actuators to adjust these values if they are not within a desired range. The code sets up the GPIO pins for the sensors and actuators and defines the desired values for humidity, pH, light level, and nutrient input. It then enters a loop that reads the current values from the sensors, compares them to the desired values, and activates or deactivates the appropriate actuators to adjust the values if necessary. The code also prints the current readings to the console and sleeps for a minute before taking another reading. This process repeats indefinitely.
